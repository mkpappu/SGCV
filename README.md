# The Switching Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (i.e. Switching Gaussian Controlled Variance)

The purpose of the switching HGF is to track a non-stationary (volatile) signal. The HGF has been used to model behavior within a changing environment, and the SHGF is an extension of this model that considers
behavioral outcomes over a set period of time as resulting from dynamics of several systems, rather than a single system. For our purposes, we are interested in the Probabilistic Reversal Learning task and have 
previously used the HGF to track inferred beliefs of individuals who experience psychosis.

The motivation for extending the HGF model is that we think the reward_tally, or the total number of points at each of 160 trials, might be a signal that submits to regime-switching dynamics.

## Overview and where did we get these scripts?

## Implementation (and key functions)

## Inference (how do we know the number of regimes?)

## What do results and figures mean?
